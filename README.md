>**NOTICE** : *For those who are english speakers or someone who is from different country, I would like to address something related to the word *'cp'*. No, it does not mean what you think it is. In china, 'cp' usually means **couple pairing (配对 / 情侣)**. It comes from the English word “couple”, and in Chinese internet slang it refers to: Romantic pairings in fiction (anime, dramas, novels, games, etc.) Fans “shipping” two characters (or sometimes two real-life people, like celebrities or idols).
It doesn’t always mean they are an actual couple, it can just be an imagined or fan-supported pairing. (Thank you to the person that pointed this out, I didn't want to seem weird.)*

哈喽～我是陈辰颖，但你可以叫我mei，和我的英文名是kim/kimmy，随便叫哪个都可以。我15岁啦，平时喜欢画画，数位板和手绘都会画～ 有时候还会画点小漫画，都是我喜欢的角色或者cp嘿嘿

可以随时来跟我聊天～只是我不太擅长社交，面对新朋友时会有点害羞和尴尬 ( ๑ơ ₃ ơ) 我会说英语啦，不过不是很厉害。所以你不用专门翻译和我聊，谷歌翻译有时候也翻得怪怪的ww

想了解我多一点可以去看看我的SP！
